# n8n-nodes-0-CodeKit

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use 0-CodeKit in your n8n workflows.

0-CodeKit (formerly 1SaaS) brings you the tool platform for all your projects when working with low-code, no-code, APIs and automation.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
